# myPSP

## Introduction

`myPSP` is my own implementation of [Personal Software Process (PSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_software_process). PSP is a self-improvement software process for software engineers to improve the work quality precisely, quantitatively, and continously.

The key to excellent PSP is **discipline**. Without discipline one could hardly achieve anything. However, discipline is a quality that most people are in lack of, because it counters human's nature of laziness.

This repository is a (yet-another) attempt to equip myself with this methodology that I believe can help me work increasingly better. I want to become an outstanding software engineer. I don't want to die silently as a mediocrity.

## Strategy

Because **discipline** is the key, and small changes are easier to make than bigger ones, I plan to employ [the idea of incrementalism](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/in-praise-of-incrementalism/): **define my baseline process, and improve bit by bit**. Fortunately, I am not starting out of nothing. In the past four years, I have built up the habit to record my time consumption every day. Recording the time is one of the key activities in producing data for predictable work estimation, and I know it is an activity that few can keep doing. This gives me some confidence that I can achieve what I want to do, as long as I concentrate on it.

## Artifacts

The folder `myPSP` has content as follows:

- `Scripts`: This folder has the definition of my personal process which I am currently using.
- `PEPs`: This folder has the Process Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) which I plan to build into my work habit.

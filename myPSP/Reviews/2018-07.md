- I want a convenient task tracking system in which I can **easily break a larger task into smaller tasks** as the sub-tasks. The sub-tasks can be divided further in a recursive way.
  - But before I create my own task tracking system, I should try harder to use YouTrack.
  - What really matters is the parent task implementation time should be the sum of all its immediate child tasks.
- I need to keep reminding myself of focusing on the task scope. Why don't I always focus on the scope? It's because I don't define the scope. When planning the task in the morning, I write down the vague description of the task and then start to work on it without working out a **roadmap**. In fact, **if I can't work out the roadmap for a task, that means I need to break it into smaller ones**.
- Therefore, I probably need **more planning** on my tasks before implementing them. In fact, my planning is already part of implementation.

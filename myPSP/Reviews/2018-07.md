- I want a convenient task tracking system in which I can **easily break a larger task into smaller tasks** as the sub-tasks. The sub-tasks can be divided further in a recursive way.
  - But before I create my own task tracking system, I should try harder to use YouTrack.
  - What really matters is the parent task implementation time should be the sum of all its immediate child tasks.
- I need to keep reminding myself of focusing on the task scope. Why don't I always focus on the scope? It's because I don't define the scope. When planning the task in the morning, I write down the vague description of the task and then start to work on it without working out a **roadmap**. In fact, **if I can't work out the roadmap for a task, that means I need to break it into smaller ones**.
- Therefore, I probably need **more planning** on my tasks before implementing them. In fact, my planning is already part of implementation.

I need to work out an initial list of the task types I want to track:

- **Coding task:** Implement a feature (including the tests) or fix a bug. Note that the necessary documentation is also part of coding.
- **Learning task:** Study a library, a piece of software, or a technical article.
- **Documentation task:** Document something such as a process or some legacy code. The usual documentation work while working on a feature development or bug fixing is *NOT* counted as documentation task.

- When reviewing the current day activities, I need to **pay attention to whether I have successfully managed the task scope or not**. Scope management is why I introduced the task roadmap. I need to ensure I have the sensation to minimize scope creeping. This is why I added the "Review" column to the "Script Execution Overview" table.
- A new type of task: **"Reviewing task"**
- I need to focus on what is really important to me. For example, I want to improve my throughput. Then I need to collect data to figure out what factors may hinder me from finishing more tasks. Although collecting task estimation data looks intriguing, it is not my current focus so I should put it aside.
- So **WHAT IS PREVENTING ME FROM FINISHING MORE TASKS?** It's the web development proficiency. Because I have never done web development before, I am not familiar with a lot of tools, libraries and other fundamental knowledge (such as HTTP protocol and security). If I know them well, I should be able to finish the task faster. So the **possible solution** is: caching up with the web development knowledge ASAP.

## 2018/07/18 (Wednesday)

- Today, I only planned three tasks, but I forgot to define the roadmap for one of them. This is because the first task was a meeting whose scope had been defined in the invitation email and I knew it well; the third task was a task I started yesterday so its scope was clearly defined yesterday. As a result, I forgot to define the scope for the second task because I had the impression in mind that "the task scope has been defined already" (true for the other two, but not for all). How should I prevent this from happening again? The **possible solution** is to print the script out and put it on my desk so it's easily seen to remind me of the process I should follow.

## 2018/07/19 (Thursday)

- Opps! I totally forgot to plan the tasks in the morning! When I came in this morning, I found an unread email, so I started to read and reply it. Then I forgot to plan the tasks and moved ahead to the work I didn't finish yesterday. Although there actually wasn't much to plan, the thing is I failed to follow the process I defined. I think there are two reasons. First, I haven't built in the habit of planning; second, there isn't anything to remind me of doing this if I forget. The **possible solution** is to set up a reminder, like the one I set to remind myself of daily reflections, for the morning plan as well.
- I need to record all the time consumption during the day: actual work time, resession time, even restroom time. The point is I would like to know how much time I use for effective recovery and how much is in fact "wasted" (maybe handling a phone call).

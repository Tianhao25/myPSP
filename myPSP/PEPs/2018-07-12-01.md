## Problem Description

The PSP `2018-07-11` does not have task time estimation as part of planning. However, improving the estimating accuracy is one of the purpose of my PSP. The estimate includes time and size, but I will start with time estimate first.

## Action Items

- [ ] Incorporate task estimation as part of planning.
  - This may take at least 4 weeks to build this process into my mind.

## Problem Description

Although recording the data is important, reviewing the data is more important because this is when the reflection happens. If I keep recording the data without reviewing them, the data are not helping me and hence meaningless.

## Action Items

- [ ] Add `Review` to the work process.
- [ ] Build this action into daily work routine in order to close this PEP.

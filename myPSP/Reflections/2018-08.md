## 2018/08/01 (Wednesday)

In the past several weeks, Bill has been working on the new build system. Last week, he asked me to work on creating a VirtualBox image that can be used as a Jenkins worker to build code.

Today, he asked me whether I could finish the VM image so when he merged the code back to `master` branch, we could start to use the VM image to build code. It wasn't this moment that I realized I failed to do some things I should have done much earlier:

- Firstly, I didn't realize that my work was in fact closely related with his work. Once you realized this, it looked very obvious: he was working on the build system; I was working on the VM image that would be used to build code. Sure, when he merged the code back to `master`, we wanted the Jenkins build system to use the new VM image to provision worker machines to build code.
- Secondly, I didn't know his progress and how far he thought he may finish the work on his side, which was also the time I should finish my work.
- Even if I could have solved the two questions above, I still didn't do one thing well enough: keep communicating with him to understand how much I should do. Our code building infrastructure was not fully automated yet, so there would be a lot of work to do. I couldn't finish all the work, of course. Then I should have talked more with him about how much I need to finish. Meanwhile, the communication could also let me know how far he was away from completion so I could adjust my work accordingly.

This was a real good lesson.

The first two issues were about **understanding the context of the task**. Whenever I start to work on a task, I need to understand:

- Whose work is this task related with?
- When should this task be finished? Even if there is no specific completion date, some people may expect this task to be finished so they can use it. I need to figure out **who** has this expectation.

The third issue was about **managing task scope**. I need to communicate with the people who are related with my task to know whether I should make more effort on it or cut off some features of lower priority to make it complete earlier.
